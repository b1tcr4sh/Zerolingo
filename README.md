### Scripts for farming xp on Duolingo spanish by spamming stories.


## Usage
This is a monorepo setup, with both a C# .NET version, and a Javascript Node.js version of the same project.  This means that you can either download the source code and compile it, or run it with Node yourself.  Or, you could download one of the pre-compiled releases on the right.  These scripts use [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) and [Puppeteersharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) respectively.
