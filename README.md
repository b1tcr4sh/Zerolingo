### Scripts for farming xp on Duolingo spanish by spamming stories.
> *What do you mean "This isn't doing your homework"?*

### This is a mini-project with a cringetastic name that I'm doing to help me practice my C# skills, learn more about web protocol, and learn how to use puppeteer *and definitely not to do my homwework for me or anything.*

## Usage
This is a monorepo setup, with both a C# .NET version, and a Javascript Node.js version of the same project.  This means that you can either download the source code and compile it, or run it with Node yourself.  Or, you could download one of the pre-compiled releases on the right.  These scripts use [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) and [Puppeteersharp](https://github.com/hardkoded/puppeteer-sharp) respectively.
